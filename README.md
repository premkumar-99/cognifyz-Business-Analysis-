# cognifyz-Business-Analysis-
This repository contains my project work completed during the Business Analytics Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The internship focused on analyzing survey data, performing descriptive &amp; statistical analysis, and generating meaningful business insights.
ðŸš€ Project Overview

The project involved step-by-step data analysis tasks ranging from beginner-level data exploration to advanced insights and visualizations.
All tasks were performed in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) using Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
Internship Tasks

Task 1: Data Overview â†’ Loaded the dataset, checked structure, rows/columns, data types, missing values.

Task 2: Gender Distribution â†’ Visualized gender split using bar and pie charts.

Level 2: Intermediate

Task 3: Descriptive Statistics â†’ Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

Task 4: Most Preferred Investment Avenue â†’ Identified most chosen investment option through frequency analysis.

Level 3: Advanced

Task 5: Reasons for Investment â†’ Summarized reasons using word frequency analysis.

Task 6: Savings Objectives â†’ Listed and visualized main savings goals of participants.
